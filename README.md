# TOPIC MODELLING IN SHORT TEXT
# K-means-Spectral-clustering-on-twitter-dataset

Spectral clustering holds a lot of significance in the domain of natural language processing. In this project, the performance of spectral clustering has been compared with k-means clustering for topic modeling, which has been applied on a tweets dataset. In addition, various performance measures have been taken to conclude under which
clustering algorithm, topic modeling performs better.
## Keywords: Topic Modeling, K-Means Clustering, Spectral Clustering.

Topic modeling is a popular technique used in natural language processing to automati-cally discover the latent topics present in a corpus of text data. However, when it comesto short texts, such as tweets or product reviews, topic modeling faces several challenges.
The problem statement for topic modeling using short texts can be framed as follows:
Given a dataset of short texts, the goal is to automatically discover the underlying topics in the corpus and identify the relevant keywords associated with each topic. In this particular project, i have tried to find out which clustering method, under which vectorization technique, performs better topic modeling. However, short texts present several challenges for topic modeling, such as limited contextual information, sparse word frequency distributions, and a high degree of noise and variability.

Researchers have developed several specialized techniques for topic modeling on short texts, such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Short Text Topic Modeling
(STTM), and Topical Word Embeddings (TWE). These methods leverage additional information such as user profiles or external knowledge bases to improve the accuracy
of topic modeling on short texts.
