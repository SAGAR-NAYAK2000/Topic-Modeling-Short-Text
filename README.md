#TOPIC MODELLING IN SHORT TEXT

Spectral clustering holds a lot of significance in the domain of natural language processing. In this project, the performance of spectral clustering has been compared with k-means clustering for topic modeling, which has been applied on a tweets dataset. In addition, various performance measures have been taken to conclude under which
clustering algorithm, topic modeling performs better.
